"""
Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.
A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that arenâ€™t necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order 
as they appear in the array. For example these numbers [1, 3, 4] from a subsequence of the array [1, 2, 3, 4], and so do the numbers
[2, 4]. Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequences of the array.

Sample Input
array = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
sequence = [1, 6, -1, 10]
