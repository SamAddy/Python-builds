Select CITY FROM STATION WHERE CITY LIKE 'A%' or CITY LIKE 'E%' or CITY LIKE 'I%' or CITY LIKE 'O%' or CITY LIKE 'U%';

3. Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
/*

*/
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE CITY NOT LIKE '[AEIOU]%';

4. Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
